            <h2 class="talk-name">You Got This, Happy Accidents Count and Other Accessibility Pep Talks</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">Recently Cherry got asked to give a talk in a studio to “bring smiles and inspiration to everyone” and all they can think is that no-one at the organisation has seen any of their talks. Well, ok, sure they’re decent at motivating people but usually it’s emotional and the jokes are awkward accidents at best. This talk will be no different, except there sadly isn’t enough time for their usual gentleness so this will be more like a wallop. They do promise it’ll be a practical wallop and you’ll learn a lot about accessibility.</p>

                <p>Cherry Thompson is an accessibility consultant with a professional background in photography, film and visual art. After a 12 year career in these fields, disability led them to shift focus and adapt to a new career. They bring their experience in design, production and exploring marginalized identities with visual storytelling to the games industry. Cherry's disabilities have allowed them to specialize in accessibility in games with a particular focus on addressing complex motor and cognitive barriers. They've consulted on projects of various sizes from small indie developments to larger studios such as Xbox (Adaptive Controller), Guerrilla (Horizon Zero Dawn IP), The Coalition (Gears of War IP) and more. Their consulting experience includes education, work-shopping, design consultation, sensitivity reviews, accessibility audits and play testing. In addition, Cherry has delivered educational presentations in various studios and at GDC, Microsoft Bootcamp, EA and their favorite, the Games Accessibility Conference.

This session shares a sense of how the the accessibility landscape has shifted over the past year, where the industry is currently at, and where it will be heading in future.</p>

            <h2 class="talk-name">Time for some action! Fractions of Friction</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">Bryce is going to return to his hometown and picks some fights. He’ll tell you that generic accessibility is not enough. Designers that don’t aim higher by making inclusive design an intentional part of their process are wasting opportunities to innovate. This talk is frivolous and will likely only be given once &#x1F60A He may lose some friends.</p>

            <h2 class="talk-name">Finding The Sweet Spot Between Bored and Overwhelmed</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">For someone with an attention related disability, fun is had when activities live in the space between boring and overwhelming. That "Sweet Spot" is critical when we are talking about playability and most importantly, the enjoyability of video games. Too overstimulating and the game can cause harm, too boring and the game becomes another unbearable chore. In this talk, Shell Little, an Accessibility Specialist with ADHD, will discuss the different elements that can make or break a game for someone with a range of Cognitive Disabilities and why she probably hasn't played your favorites. Attendees will leave this talk with not only a better understanding of common barriers experienced by people with Cognitive Disabilities but also with concrete examples of ways to help users find their own "Sweet Spot".</p>

        <section id="Beyond-the-code" class="talk">
            <h2 class="talk-name">Beyond the code: Accessibility of language, tone, culture, and concept</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">Creating an accessible game needs to be a part of the conversation long before a single line of code is ever written. Of course we need to take the accessibility of the actual game mechanics into account, but the conversation and decision to include accessibility need to begin at an earlier point and cover a broader range of topics than just the code. In this talk we will look at factors that are often overlooked in the industry, such as using accessible language and tone in creating initial game concepts and story lines, creating a physically accessible space for game development, avoiding an unintentionally ableist game design culture overall, and more.</p>

                <p class="speaker-bio">I have Multiple Sclerosis and also a traumatic brain injury as a result of a massive ischemic stroke, and have used video games as a part of my rehabilitation process. Before my disability, I worked in the game development industry and have since narrowed my focus to accessible game design. While I am mainly known for my career as a Twitch Streamer and Youtuber who reviews games for their accessible content, but I also work freelance as an accessibility consultant for video game development companies. I am a member of the Accessibility Advisory Committee for the city of Guelph, an accessibility consultant for the Site Planning Committee in Guelph, and work with a number of local nonprofit organizations promoting accessibility in many areas. I am also queer, and am incredibly passionate about advocating for the LGBT2QIA+ disabled community. Striving for a world that is built for all of us is a huge passion of mine.</p>

            <h2 class="talk-name">HyperDotA11y: How an Itty Bitty Indie Game Does Flexibility Research</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">"Flexibility in design is a central part of HyperDot, an action arcade game with one rule: dodge everything. The game included high-contrast and colorblind modes early on, plus HyperDot supports a wide variety of traditional and alternative controllers. When the HyperDot team decided to further deepen the game's flexibility, they knew lab research wouldn't cut it.</p>
            <p>Enter #HyperDotA11y, an experimental research project that put players with disabilities at the heart of flexibility design. The HyperDot team recruited disabled streamers and content creators to play a demo of the game and share their feedback live. This lightning talk will cover the research results, what worked, what needs improvement, and how the HyperDot team plans to implement in-game changes based on the research.</p>
