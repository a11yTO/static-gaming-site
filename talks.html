<section id="maximum-fun-minimal-harm" class="talk">
  <h2 class="talk-name">Maximum Fun, Minimal Harm: Ethics and Intentionality in Game Design</h2>
  <p class="talk-desc">As games become more accessible for a variety of players, we cannot declare victory once players can all simply get to and play games. We may declare games to be accessible, but to call them inclusive requires navigating a much trickier set of pitfalls. Systemic issues such as dark patterns, low representation and diversity, lack of content warnings and portrayals of violence against marginalized groups still plague video games. Accessibility in video games has made huge progress but true inclusion of the disabled community has a long way to go. </p>
