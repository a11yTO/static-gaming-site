    <p>Truths & Insights is a web-based digital bonding experience that brings together people across organization(s) to have courageous conversations through storytelling and gamification. Designed as a card game, it helps people in finding their voice and having their voices heard on topics like Accessibility, Culture & Values, and Sustainability; thus driving empathy and raising collective learning. With Azure cognitive services and analytics, Truths & Insights enables leaders to get insights on the strategic needs of their team through reflection, rethinking options, and relearning assumptions to create conditions of effective allyship and eventually drive action.</p>
    <p>The Accessibility Edition is ideally played with your organization’s CHRO, accessibility champion(s), business leads, and a moderator from Microsoft. Reach out to your Microsoft Account Lead today to discuss how you can host a session for your team or organization.</p>
