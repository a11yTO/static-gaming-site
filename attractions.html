  <h2 class="talk-name">Truths & Insights</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Truths & Insights is a web-based digital bonding experience that brings together people across organization(s) to have courageous conversations through storytelling and gamification. Designed as a card game, it helps people in finding their voice and having their voices heard on topics like Accessibility, Culture & Values, and Sustainability; thus driving empathy and raising collective learning. With Azure cognitive services and analytics, Truths & Insights enables leaders to get insights on the strategic needs of their team through reflection, rethinking options, and relearning assumptions to create conditions of effective allyship and eventually drive action.</p>
    <p>The Accessibility Edition is ideally played with your organization’s CHRO, accessibility champion(s), business leads, and a moderator from Microsoft. Reach out to your Microsoft Account Lead today to discuss how you can host a session for your team or organization.</p>
    <p>Please note: As LinkedIn is required for logging into the game, please check your LinkedIn login prior to participation. We don't want you scrambling for your credentials as the game is about to begin!</p>
