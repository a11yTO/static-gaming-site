<h2>The Event</h2>
<p><strong>#a11yTO Gaming</strong> is back!</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that <strong>#a11yTO Gaming</strong> is returning as an in-person event this October! To celebrate our return, we’ve completely reimagined the format and incorporated a more “activity focused” approach to this year’s event!</p>
<p>This means in addition to talks from industry leaders and needle-movers, we are also including multiple installations including: an accessible gaming arcade, QA sessions with experts, live gaming demos, and much much more to be announced in the coming weeks!</p>
<p>Tickets are on sale now for the early bird price of $49! <a href="#">Get yours today</a>!</p>
