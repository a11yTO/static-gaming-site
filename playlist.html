  <h2 class="talk-name">Building Equitable and Inclusive Studios with Disabled Employees</h2>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>Video games are becoming more and more accessible for disabled people but the games industry still has a ways to go with accessible and inclusive employment opportunities for disabled people. We will cover just a few of the things you can do to ensure your studio is creating these opportunities with disabled employees and job seekers. Pulling from both television and video games, I will discuss why it's essential to caption for immersion in games and entertainment media but equally important to caption for meaning when content is educational in nature.</p>
