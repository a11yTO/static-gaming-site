With Azure cognitive services and analytics, Truths & Insights enables leaders to get insights on the strategic needs of their team through reflection, rethinking options, and relearning assumptions to create conditions of effective allyship and eventually drive action.</p>
    <p>The Accessibility Edition is ideally played with your organization’s CHRO, accessibility champion(s), business leads, and a moderator from Microsoft. Reach out to your Microsoft Account Lead today to discuss how you can host a session for your team or organization.</p>
