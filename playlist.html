<h2>Talks</h2>

<section id="Accessibility-by-Design" class="talk">
  <h3 class="talk-name">Accessibility by Design: Finding Our Way on the Path Less Traveled</h3>
  <div class="talk-desc">
    <p>The days of convincing people that accessibility is important are over and now is a critical time to share a more advanced and nuanced understanding of designing for accessibility. Whatever path we're on, we can redirect to create more immersive and equitable player experiences.</p>
    <p>This session defines accessibility in a new light, moving forward from accessibility as "accessibility options" into a new era of accessibility by design. Aderyn will draw from 7 years of industry and 15 years of design experience to dig deep and redefine everything; what is challenge? And is empathy really the answer?</p>
    <p>Using examples from real life and tech, Aderyn will demonstrate how to mature our approaches by avoiding more process, playing catchup, providing "assists", or making accommodations to players. Learn how everything is a system, including bias. And since designers are very comfortable with systems, we can head confidently into the future.</p>

  <h3 class="talk-name">roll="dice"</h3>

    <p>Before there were MMORPGs, there were groups of friends gathered around a table participating in a truly interactive shared story-telling experience. A regular table-top RPG gamer since he was a kid, Adrian will talk about some of the challenges and affordances offered both by the nature of the game itself and some tools available to gamers. This is not a how-to, but more a loose collection of resources and suggestions.</p>
