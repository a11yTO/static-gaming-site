    <p>Aderyn is the Design Lead on Ubisoft’s Accessibility team. They're responsible for the games arm of the team and are currently focusing on building a brand new knowledge base, resources, and design documentation to drive Ubisoft's development practices. As the lead they've worked alongside the director to hire and mentor the team's Accessibility Specialists.</p>
    <p>With collaboration, compassion, and teaching at the core of their approach, the whole team supports Ubisoft's flagship IPs to achieve accessibility excellence through intentional design.</p>
    <p>Aderyn is always thinking of the future of game design and, for them, integrated design is the only sensible future for accessibility. Only as a core pillar can we dismantle the stigma that an accessible player experience should be siloed as “special” or different.</p>
    <p>Additional and extensive experience with disability and 2SLGBTQIA+ activism informs every aspect of their practice. Before joining Ubisoft in 2020, Aderyn worked freelance as an accessibility specialist across multiple major studios and indie developments. They've delivered or participated in over 20 talks and panels since 2018. Their career in games was built on top of a 15-year career in art and film.</p>
    <p>Aderyn’s work on Far Cry 6, Watch Dogs: Legion, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, and HyperDot led to recognition for these titles at The Game Awards two years in a row; a highlight of their 7-year career and well fought for after 10+ years of advocacy in the industry. They also humbly received several honours: Canadian Game Awards Winner, The Game Awards Future Class 2020, GI: 100 Game Changers, appeared in Women in Gaming: 100 Professionals of Play, and even contributed Motion Capture for Marvel’s Avengers.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, it's always their cat Odin who ensures they finish their days on time and models healthy working practices by leaving the work at their desk.</p>
